I am a CNRS postoctoral researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay in France. My scientific interest is to discover our cosmic origins by exploring the formation and evolution of the structures in our universe. In my research I use both detailed and statistical studies of galaxy samples and multi-wavelength datasets ranging from X-ray to radio, being PI and Co-I of numerous observing time proposals. I always envision my research with a local and an international scope, collaborating with both small teams and big international collaborations. I am very active in transmitting my results in international conferences and my knowledge by supervising students.

I am focused on having a complete understanding of galaxy evolution across the history of the universe, which requires connecting galaxy populations and physical processes associated to different fields of expertise in astronomy. Therefore, my research contributions expand over different aspects of galaxy evolution: star-forming and quiescent galaxies; gas, dust, and scaling relations in galaxies; active galactic nuclei; low surface brightness; surveys of galaxies; and collaborations with experts on galaxy simulations. The broad scope of my scientific interest required me to develop competences on a wide range of wavelengths, which go from the optical and near-infrared to far-infrared and radio interferometry photometry and spectroscopy.

In this personal webpage your can find my publications and CV.
